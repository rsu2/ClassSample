# columns-4-ways

Using the sample markup provided, research and demonstrate creating CSS columns – splitting the content provided up into 2 equal columns – using the following techniques:

<ol>
  <li>floated columns with divs</li>
  <li>inline-block columns with divs</li>
  <li>column count columns without added divs</li>
  <li>flexbox columns with divs</li>
</ol>

In the table in the footer area, add to the <caption> element the name of the method used to create the columns. Research the browser compatibility statistics on the method you used, and fill in the table with the correct information.

Keep in mind the following points:
<ul>
  <li>For each technique, work in a separate file, keeping your styles embedded in the HTML document.</li>
  <li>You may add/remove HTML markup as necessary.</li>
  <li>You should end up with 4 separate HTML files ready for submission.</li>
</ul>

You must complete all of the following submission requirements in order to receive a mark:
<ul>
